# BR-API (Update C11)

BR-API is an API for video game Brick Rigs.
It allows users to create and manipulate Brick Rigs' game files that handle creations (A.K.A. vehicles).

BR-API is closely tied to BrickLang, a programming language for Brick Rigs based using BR-API.
Therefore, we will also include basic information on this project.
